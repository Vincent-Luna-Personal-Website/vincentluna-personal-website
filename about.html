        <p class="about">Currently, I'm on an incredible journey at Fullstack Academy, where my passion for technology is given a purpose and a path. Fullstack Academy is not just a school; it's a community of like-minded individuals who share my love for all things tech. Here, I'm honing my skills and gaining the knowledge needed to transform my passion into a fulfilling career. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Gaming is my ultimate escape from reality, a realm where I can embark on epic adventures, strategize my way to victory, and connect with a global community of like-minded enthusiasts. From exploring the rich narratives of role-playing games to mastering the precision of competitive shooters, I find endless joy and challenge in the diverse world of gaming. It's not just a hobby; it's a source of inspiration and a boundless well of entertainment that fuels my creativity and passion.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While gaming is a significant part of my life, I also recognize the importance of balance. When I'm not exploring virtual worlds, you'll find me enjoying the great outdoors, delving into books and movies, or pursuing creative endeavors. It's all about finding harmony between the digital and physical realms.</p>
